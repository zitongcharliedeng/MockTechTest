You are writing a piece of software that operates 6 elevators in a building with 12 floors, let's call this the elevator control center (ECC)

The ECC is aware of which of the 12 floors each elevator is on. The ECC is also aware, for each elevator, of which floors have been summoned by passengers already. The ECC also knows whether each elevator is going up or down.

I could also be on any of the 12 floors. When I call an elevator, I press the up or down button depending on whether I want to go up or down.

Write an algorithm that calculates which of the 6 elevators to summon in order to get me to my destination the fastest.
